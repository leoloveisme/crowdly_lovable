# Welcome to Crowdly

Crowd created entertainment entertainemnt platform - where YOUR eintertainment is

## Project info

Crowdly – Multi creator / crowd created entertainment entertainment platform – think Audible + Netflix + Github + Wattpad (text, pictures, audio and / or video [3D VR / AR and / or MR]) and all this is AI assisted. 

Currently the project is in the development and in it's very baby shoes. The idea behind the project is quite mature, however the realisation isn't, because however good Lovable is, it unfortunately isn't good enough to make it run as intended by the founder, without the need to spend a fortune on making it true.

The project is quite complex and it will have an online platform, local client (software) and apps for major OSes. 

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
